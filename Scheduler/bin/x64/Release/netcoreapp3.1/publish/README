This README file describes the Scheduler setup. 

Assuume the Scheduler folder is in C drive and renamed to 'XXX_Folder', 

C:\xxxx_Folder\ 
              \setup.bat
              \setup.ps1
              \Scheduler.exe
              \Scheduler.config
              
Scheduler.exe is a designated C# Windows service program, using dotCore 3.1 framework. 

Go to https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1 to download and install dotCore 3.1 framework foremost.
	
'setup.ps1' is a powershell script. The script must be run in administrative mode.
	
'setup.ps1' IS TO RUN ONCE! It looks into current directory where Scheduler.exe resides, and create a 'Logs' folder and
update 'Scheduler.config' file where the Logs folder is located at.

Next it creates a Window Service named Scheduler and point to  Scheduler.exe with a argument refers to the config file. 

Finally, the script will start the service.

Alternatively, setup.bat works the same as setup.ps1. It also needs to RUN ONCE as explained and need to run in administrative mode as well.

In order for any changes in the config file to take effect, the Scheduler Window Service MUST STOP first.
After config file edit is done, start the Scheduler Window Service. 

For example if the user decides to relocate the Logs folder, inside the config file, look for the key <-log_save_location>.
And if the new Logs folder is at 'C:\Foos\Logs' then the key line will look like <-log_save_location=C:\Logs>. 

If the Logs folder is not found(non-existent), then the log files will be logged and saved in C:\Windows\System32\

If there is a upgrade upon the Scheduler.exe, first stop the service, copy and paste over the Scheduler.exe, then start the service once more. 

Once the Scheduler folder is re-assigned, after the copy and paste, run setup once more.

It is possible to create more than 1 Scheduler services(All different service names) and refer to the same Scheduler.exe. 

IT IS RECOMMENDED NOT TO DO SO! An alternative solution is to duplicate Scheduler folder and run the setup in it. There is no
gurantee the process will be effective with by running Scheduler.exe in multiple process.

Scheduler.exe is ALSO configure to be a GRPC server! Therefore every distinct Scheduler services must have a valid IP/Port setting
found in the config file.
